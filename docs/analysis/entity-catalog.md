# Entity catalog

The single source of truth for every `sc_` entity (the [`sc_` prefix](system-overview.md#entity-naming-convention)
convention). The [glossary](system-overview.md#ubiquitous-language) stays authoritative for each
term's **meaning**; this catalog is authoritative for each entity's **binding** — its id, role,
unit, default/range, and which behaviour reads or writes it.

**How to read it:**

- **Role** — `config` (a user-set helper), `sensor` (wraps an upstream device/source entity per
  NF3), or `state` (a value the system itself maintains, including the output wrappers it writes).
- **Realizes** — the glossary term the entity binds; where a parameter has no dedicated glossary
  term, the requirement that defines it (e.g. R1) is cited instead. The catalog never re-defines a
  term — it links to it.
- **Read by / Written by** — the mechanism docs and use-cases that touch the entity (bidirectional
  traceability). Seeded here from the committed `control-cycle.md` and `resolution-rules.md`; each
  use-case task fills in its own references as it lands. `user` / `external` denote a human or an
  external source (calendar, app, vehicle) rather than a document. A name in **parentheses**, e.g.
  `(UC09)`, is a placeholder marking the use-case expected to add that reference — it is not yet a
  current reference.
- Raw upstream entities are **never** catalog rows — they appear only as the *source* noted on a
  `sensor`-role wrapper. The one platform entity used directly is `sun.sun` (see notes); it is not
  a device, so NF3 does not require a wrapper.
- Ids and defaults not already fixed in the glossary are **assigned here** and become canonical;
  defaults match the values stated in `requirements.md`.

Internal bookkeeping that is pure implementation — cooldown/hold timers, the smoothing ring
buffer, reminder/prompt "already-sent" flags, restart-after-power-loss persistence — is **not**
catalogued (it is "how", per the design doc). The catalog covers the configurable parameters, the
device-I/O wrappers, and the domain-level state and outputs the use-cases reference by name.

## Config entities (user-set)

Every entity in this section is `config` role, so the Role column is omitted here; entities are
grouped by functional concern.

### Capabilities

| Entity id | Domain | Unit | Default / range | Realizes | Read by | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input_boolean.sc_solar_available` | input_boolean | — | on (present) | [capability](system-overview.md#ubiquitous-language) — solar (R18) | resolution-rules, (UC01, UC02, UC06, UC07) | user |

> Extensible: a future capability (e.g. a home battery) would add one row here and gate its own modes/behaviours (R18, NF2).

## Notes

- **`sun.sun`** is read directly by `resolution-rules.md` (the [sun is down](system-overview.md#ubiquitous-language)
  condition) and is the one exception to the wrap-everything rule: it is a Home Assistant platform
  entity, not a device, so NF3 does not require an `sc_` wrapper.
- **`effective peak limit`, the resolved `active SOC limit`, and the resolved `departure deadline`
  have no entity.** Each is resolved every cycle by a rule in `resolution-rules.md` (from
  `sc_max_peak_kw`/`sc_monthly_peak_kw`, from the active-SOC-limit inputs, and from the departure
  inputs respectively); they are computed values, not stored helpers. If a future use-case needs
  one materialized for observability, it would add the row and its references then.
- **Output wrappers (`number.sc_charger_current`, `number.sc_vehicle_charge_limit`)** satisfy the
  NF3 requirement that every command crosses an `sc_` wrapper; a start/stop is expressed as a 0 A
  set-point on the current wrapper.
- The `<dow>` row stands for seven concrete entities (`sc_departure_mon` … `sc_departure_sun`),
  collapsed to keep the table readable.
- **Solar-dependent entities are conditional on the solar capability (R18).** When
  `sc_solar_available` is off, the `Solar`/`SolarOnly` mode configs, the Solar SOC step-up and
  Solar-reserve configs, and the solar sensors (`sc_solar_power_w`, `sc_solar_forecast_kwh`) are
  not required; the `Auto` rule skips the solar mode accordingly.
- **The `sc_active_mode` selector offers only the modes available under the current capabilities
  (R18).** Without the solar capability, `Solar` and `SolarOnly` are not offered for manual
  selection; `Captar`, `Power`, and `Off` are always offered. This is where R18's manual-availability
  criterion is realized (the `Manual` profile itself needs no rule — the user sets the mode directly).
